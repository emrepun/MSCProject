Munich,"731,250 reviews and opinions","Munich was almost completely destroyed in two world wars, yet it's managed to recreate much of its folkloric, Bavarian past. Oktoberfest is legendary, but you can visit the Hofbrauhaus any time of year for an immense beer. Olympiapark, the site of the 1972 games, is not to be missed (you can skate on the Olympic ice rink and swim in the pool). On a somber note, take time to visit the concentration camp at Dachau—it's an intense, yet unforgettable, glimpse into the not-too-distant horrors of the Holocaust.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/03/9b/2d/ed/munich.jpg
Prague,"1,690,403 reviews and opinions","We hear the question, ""What’s the next Prague?"" a lot. But while we’re all for discovering great new destinations, we hardly think Prague is over. Sure, everyone’s heard of it, but it’s still a grand city with extraordinary historic and cultural sights, and it’s definitely worth a visit. The often-rebuilt Prague Castle has overlooked the city since the 9th century, and the synagogues and cemetery of the Jewish Quarter are must-sees. Nightlife here is diverse and plentiful, from trendy clubs to sophisticated wine bars to late-night cellar bars.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/12/f7/4e/50/prague.jpg
Stockholm,"539,546 reviews and opinions","The capital city of Sweden combines modern attractions with historic charm. Kick off your stay with visits to Stockholm’s two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Royal Palace Drottningholm (the residence of the royal family) and the magical Skogskyrkogården, or Woodland Cemetery. Stroll the cobblestone streets of Old Town and over the picturesque bridges that span the city’s canals. The 19th-century Skansen was the world’s first open-air museum and is still a premier place to learn about Swedish history.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f9/5e/stockholm.jpg
San Francisco,"1,194,045 reviews and opinions","Who cares about a little fog (okay, a lot of fog) when there’s so much to do in San Francisco? By day, explore Fisherman’s Wharf and the Aquarium of the Bay, ride a cable car, and stroll around the Presidio; by night, have a fabulous dinner (at a Michelin-starred restaurant or a tiny place in Chinatown), then hit some of the best clubs on the West Coast.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/34/00/cf/san-francisco.jpg
St. Petersburg,"657,532 reviews and opinions","The second largest city in Russia, St. Petersburg is the country’s cultural heart. View splendid architectural gems like the Winter Palace and the Kazan Cathedral, and give yourself plenty of time to browse the world-renowned art collection of the Hermitage. Sprawling across the Neva River delta, St. Petersburg offers enough art, nightlife, fine dining and cultural destinations for many repeat visits.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/05/a4/e0/27/st-petersburg.jpg
Miami,"477,272 reviews and opinions","Whether you're into sport, sunshine or salsa, Miami sizzles all year round with exciting entertainment venues and attractions, world-class hotels and restaurants, great beaches and a nightlife that never sleeps. While South Beach, with its hip nightclubs and pastel-hued buildings, gets all the press, other sections of Miami are just as hot and offer culture, recreation and more. Spend the day soaking in the sights and sounds of Little Havana or soaking up the rays at Haulover Beach Park. Explore the Art Deco District or take the children to the zoo. At the end of the day, chill out at one of the area's bars and nightclubs. In Miami at night, the day is just beginning.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/ff/26/miami.jpg
Barcelona,"3,136,874 reviews and opinions","Stroll Las Ramblas and enjoy Barcelona's unique blend of Catalan culture, distinctive architecture, lively nightlife and trendy, stylish hotels. You'll find Europe's best-preserved Gothic Quarter here, as well as amazing architectural works by Gaudi. La Sagrada Familia, considered Gaudi's masterpiece, is still under construction (your entrance fee helps to fund the project). Feel like a picnic? Look no further than the rambunctious La Boqueria market, where you can stock up on local delicacies.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f7/ce/barcelona.jpg
New York City,"4,140,000 reviews and opinions","The first time you go to New York, go ahead and be a sight-seer—everyone should visit the Statue of Liberty, the Met, Times Square, etc. But on a return trip, pick a neighbourhood and go deep. You’ll find hole-in-the-wall bars, great delis, quirky shops… exploring the non-touristy side of New York is an incredibly rewarding experience for a traveller.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/12/f7/4a/9b/new-york-city.jpg
Istanbul,"1,177,875 reviews and opinions","Europe and Asia meet in Istanbul, and throughout this vibrant city, you’ll find centuries-old mosques, churches and markets happily co-existing with modern restaurants, galleries and nightclubs. And plan on visiting a hamman (traditional Turkish bath)—for about $20 your skin will be scrubbed clean. And we mean scrubbed. Your wimpy loofah has nothing on this.","""https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/2560x500/18/2d/42/21/istanbul-coverphoto.jpg"""
Rome,"4,902,799 reviews and opinions","It’s nicknamed the Eternal City for a reason. In Rome, you can drink from a street fountain fed by an ancient aqueduct. Or see the same profile on a statue in the Capitoline Museum and the guy making your cappuccino. (Which, of course, you know never to order after 11 am.) Rome is also a city of contrasts—what other place on earth could be home to both the Vatican and La Dolce Vita?",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/12/f7/4e/3d/rome.jpg
Bangkok,"1,826,295 reviews and opinions","Bangkok is full of exquisitely decorated Buddhist temples—as you go from one to the next you’ll be continually blown away by the craftsmanship and elabourate details. But if you’d rather seek enlightenment in a gourmet meal, or dance the night away, you’ll also enjoy Bangkok—the restaurant and nightclub scenes here are among the best in the world.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/fb/55/bangkok.jpg
London,"6,346,416 reviews and opinions","There's so much to see and do in London, it's easy to be overwhelmed. Major sights like the Tower of London and Buckingham Palace are on most visitors' itineraries, but no matter what your interests, you'll probably find something here. Art lovers should make a beeline for the National Gallery and the Tate Modern. If military history's your thing, don't miss the Cabinet War Rooms. Finally, forget everything you've heard about bland, mushy British food—the restaurant scene here is fabulous.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f5/de/london.jpg
Paris,"4,492,553 reviews and opinions","Everyone who visits Paris for the first time probably has the same punchlist of major attractions to hit: The Louvre, Notre Dame, The Eiffel Tower, etc. Just make sure you leave some time to wander the city’s grand boulevards and eat in as many cafes, bistros and brasseries as possible. And don’t forget the shopping—whether your tastes run to Louis Vuitton or Les Puces (the flea market), you can find it here.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/17/14/f3/bd/paris.jpg
Dublin,"1,200,943 reviews and opinions","You've probably heard that Guinness tastes better in Dublin (fresh from the factory), but what you may not know is that Dublin is a perfect destination for the whole family. No, we're not suggesting you let the kiddies drink a pint. Instead, take them to the Dublin Zoo, to feed the ducks in Stephen's Green or on a picnic in Phoenix Park. Scholars enjoy walking in the literary footsteps of such writers as Yeats and Joyce, while discerning shoppers have their pick of designer boutiques.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f7/0e/dublin.jpg
Hvar,"57,145 reviews and opinions","As the island retreat of choice for European jetsetters and celebrities alike, it’s easy to see why Hvar grabs headlines. Sun-soaked beaches, lavender-scented hinterlands, and cobbled medieval towns provide a welcome change of pace from the seemingly endless choice of restaurants, bars, and nightclubs.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/10/5a/f0/9b/img-20170722-133227-largejpg.jpg
Amsterdam,"1,734,783 reviews and opinions","Amsterdam is truly a biker’s city, although pedaling along the labyrinthine streets can get a little chaotic. Stick to walking and you won’t be disappointed. The gentle canals make a perfect backdrop for exploring the Jordaan and Rembrandtplein square. Pop into the Red Light District if you must—if only so you can say you’ve been there. The Anne Frank House is one of the most moving experiences a traveller can have, and the Van Gogh Museum boasts a sensational collection of works.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f9/34/amsterdam.jpg
Ibiza,"478,048 reviews and opinions","Ibiza: Old Spanish for ""party 'til you drop."" Perhaps not literally, but this is definitely one of Europe's favourite nightlife playgrounds. Ibiza boasts more than 100 miles of coastline with some 50 beaches, plus plenty of restaurants, bars, and water sports—and clubs, of course. Fit in a little culture and visit Ibiza's UNESCO-designated old town.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/14/10/2e/a4/ibiza.jpg
Berlin,"1,585,740 reviews and opinions","In progressive Berlin, the old buildings of Mitte gracefully coexist with the modern Reichstag. Don't miss top historical sights like the Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, the Brandenburg Gate and Potsdamer Platz.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f7/65/berlin.jpg
Madrid,"2,284,765 reviews and opinions","Madrid is the financial and cultural hub for Spain, and much of Southern Europe. There is a huge amount to see and do there, as well as excellent nightlife in terms of bars, restaurants, clubs and entertainment. As the area has been inhabited since Roman times, there are also plenty of historical sites to explore and enjoy. At the other extreme, you can also visit the Bernabéu stadium, home of Spanish football giant Real Madrid. This is usually popular with the younger members of the family, and many of the older ones! For art lovers you are torn between the Prado Museum, with works from the 12th to 19th Centuries including Goya, Velasquez and Rubens, or you can go to the Reina Sofia Museum for art from the 20th Century and beyond. The Reina Sofia houses Picasso's most famous painting Guernica, as well as key works by artists such as Salvador Dali - it gets incredibly busy but is a crucial place to visit!",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f7/d9/madrid.jpg
Marmaris,"202,371 reviews and opinions","A gorgeous backdrop of pine-clad mountains looms behind the seaside resort of Marmaris in southwest Turkey. Popular as a cruise ship and yacht port and with the British budget holiday crowd, Marmaris offers an abundance of fast food restaurants, the restored castle of Suleyman the Magnificent and an appealing cobblestoned old quarter. Outside the busy town, coves and bays of the Datça Peninsula make lovely daytrip destinations for those travelling by boat.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/10/54/ac/bf/dsc-0251-largejpg.jpg
Milan,"2,076,078 reviews and opinions","History lovers should know that Milan is not all about trendy shops and designer clothes. Among the city's many historical attractions are La Scala Opera, the Milan Cathedral, the National Museum of Science and Technology and Santa Maria della Grazie, the church that preserves da Vinci's ""Last Supper"".",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f8/04/milan.jpg
Brighton,"366,715 reviews and opinions","Londoners have been traveing to Brighton for beach getaways ever since the railway arrived here in 1841. The pebbled beach, Brighton Pier's amusement arcade and the Royal Pavilion are the main sights, but you'll also find hundreds of pubs and clubs catering to an energetic crowd.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/14/10/2e/0f/brighton.jpg
Athens,"672,437 reviews and opinions","Once known for smog, traffic and tacky architecture, Athens is a city reformed thanks to fortunes brought by the 2004 Summer Olympics. Spotless parks and streets, an ultra-modern metro, new motorways, an accessible airport and all signs in perfect English make the city easily negotiable. Meriting more than a stopover en route to the islands, sophisticated Athens sites include many pillars of Western history, from the Acropolis to the Temple of Olympian Zeus, as well as treasures in the National Archaeological Museum.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/f9/4c/athens.jpg
Venice,"1,220,729 reviews and opinions","With its gondolas, canals, amazing restaurants, and unforgettable romantic ambiance, Venice is definitely a city for one's bucket list. Waterfront palazzos, palaces, and churches make drifting down the Grand Canal feel like cruising through a painting. To really experience Venice you must go to the opera or to a classical music performance, nibble fresh pasta and pastries, and linger in the exhibit halls of an art gallery. Label lovers will drool over the high-end shopping in Piazza San Marco.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/12/f7/4e/87/venice.jpg
Moscow,"786,872 reviews and opinions","The political, scientific, historical, architectural and business centre of Russia, Moscow displays the country's contrasts at their most extreme. The ancient and modern exist side by side in this city of 10 million. Catch a metro from one of the ornate stations to see Red Square, the Kremlin, the nine domes of St Basil's Cathedral, Lenin's Mausoleum, the KGB Museum and other symbols of Moscow's great and terrible past, then lighten up and go shopping in Boulevard Ring, or people-watch in Pushkin Square.",https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-b/1024x250/15/33/fd/62/moscow.jpg
